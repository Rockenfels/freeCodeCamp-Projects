      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>Rowdy little downhill/freeride track. After a very quick downhill out of the gate, the route climbs up through big forest. I discovered this trail while out with my friend one day. Check yourself before you wreck yourself. You can find everyone out here having fun from people in body armor and downhill bikes to families testing their kids limits to xc racer types riding intervals.</p>

      <p>Out here you will find the most legal features including log rides, jumps and rock rolls in South Tahoe including the new jumps, berms, rollers and hips TAMBA and SBTS built in 2014. Parking at the bottom is near mile 12 of Palmer Fishhook Road, while the top of the trailhead starts near mile 16 of Palmer Fishhook Road. Other features include rock garden (that is rutted on the outer edges because XC peeps avoid it), skinny with twists and some other short elevated bridges. A super fun freeride trail starting with the Pinkbike drop, an impressive 12' by 12' drop followed non stop features with lots of speed and perfect flow. By the end of the 45-50 miles you'll be plenty tired from the constant up and down nature of Mana Road. Enough about us, we give you the Mega in action:</p>

      <h2>More on the Mega 290</h2>
      <p>Like what you saw of our team pushing the envelope with the Mega 290 Pro? It packs in a lot of excitement in a short amount of time. One of the best downhills in the area. Pretty dry and fast. Out of the parking lot, take your first left. Gets dry in the summer.</p>

<p>The climb up from Marlette Lake trail is pretty tough, but relatively short. Brief passing showers are keeping it wet but the sun and wind are trying. Two wheel drifting is likely if you have speed but are not riding the top few inches of the berms. This is the most fun direction to ride it. Unpacked snow and mud throughout.</p>

<p>drop to give you an idea of what you're getting into. There are actually three trails which make up the loop: Horse Creek-Cattle Creek-Lower Twin Lake. So be careful with your carbon frames! Lost Lake starts at its namesake trailhead. More branches down and seems they are often in bad spots, i.e. landings.</p>
